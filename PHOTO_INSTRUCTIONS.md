# How to Add Photos to Brecy's Birthday Website

## Adding New Gallery Photos

To add new photos to the gallery:

1. **Save your photos** with simple names like `image16.jpg`, `image17.jpg`, etc.
2. **Place the photos** in the `images/gallery/` folder
3. **No code changes needed** - the website will automatically display all photos in the gallery folder

## Updating the Profile Photo

To update the profile photo:

1. **Save your new profile photo** as `profile.jpg`
2. **Replace the existing file** at `images/profile/profile.jpg`
3. **Refresh the website** to see the new profile photo

## Photo Tips

- Use JPG format for best compatibility
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 2MB each) for fast loading
- Use descriptive names for your photos
- The website works best with square or landscape-oriented photos

## Technical Notes

The website uses a dynamic photo loader that:
- Automatically finds all images in the gallery folder
- Displays them in a responsive grid
- Maintains all interactive features (click to enlarge, etc.)

No coding knowledge is required to add photos!
